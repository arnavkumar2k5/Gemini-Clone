# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Gemini Clone: A Conversational AI with React.js
This project is a React.js application replicating the functionalities of Google's Gemini large language model (LLM). While not directly interfacing with the real Gemini API (due to access restrictions), it provides a user-friendly interface for simulating interactions with a conversational AI.

Features:

Text Input: Users can type their questions or prompts.
Simulated Responses: The application generates responses based on pre-defined data or logic mimicking a conversational AI.
Clean and Intuitive Interface: A user-friendly interface focuses on the interaction between the user and the AI.
Development Stack:

React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
